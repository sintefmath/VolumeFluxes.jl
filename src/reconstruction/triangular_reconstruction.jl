    reconstruct_triangular(grid, cell_values)

Compute limited piecewise-linear gradients on a `TriangularGrid`.

For every cell *i* with centroid ``\\mathbf{c}_i`` and value ``\\bar U_i``,
the three candidate gradients are obtained from the planes through
``\\mathbf{c}_i`` and two of its neighbour centroids:

```math
\\vec{g}_k = \\text{(finite difference through two centroids)}.
```

The final gradient is assembled component-wise with the three-argument
minmod limiter

```math
g^{(d)} = \\operatorname{minmod}(g_1^{(d)}, g_2^{(d)}, g_3^{(d)}).
```

Returns `gradients::Vector{SVector{N,SVector{2,Float64}}}` where `N` is
the number of conserved variables, giving the limited gradient for each
variable in each cell.

Linear reconstruction specialisation for triangular grids.  Computes limited
piecewise-linear gradients via [`reconstruct_triangular`](@ref) and caches
them for the subsequent [`compute_flux!`](@ref) call.  Cell-averaged values
are copied into `output_left`.

Since triangular grids process all edges in a single pass (direction is
irrelevant), the reconstruction is only performed for the first direction;
subsequent directions reuse the cached result.
