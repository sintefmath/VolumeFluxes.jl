# What is VolumeFluxes.jl?

VolumeFluxes (SINTEF Finite Volume Methods) is a Julia framework for solving conservation and balance laws using the finite volume method, with a strong emphasis on modelling of surface water. It is developed and maintained by the

## Modeling of surface water using VolumeFluxes.jl

## Mathematical foundation
We consider a general (hyperbolic) conservation or balance law

$$u_t + \nabla_x \cdot F(u) = S(u)\qquad \text{on}\qquad D\times [0, T)$$

where $u:D\times[0,T)\to\mathbb{R}$ is a vector of conserved (balanced) quantities, $F$ is a flux function and $S$ represents source terms. It is common to discretize such equations with the finite volume method.
