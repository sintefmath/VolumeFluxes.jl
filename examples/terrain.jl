# # Modelling of a terrain with a bay
# In this example, we will setup a simple model of a terrain with a bay. We will use the Horton infiltration model to simulate the infiltration of water into the soil. The terrain is represented by a grid, and we will use the shallow water equations to simulate the flow of water over the terrain. We will use the `SinFVM` package to setup and solve the model. The model will be solved using the `ForwardEuler` time-stepping method. We will use the `CairoMakie` package to visualize the results of the simulation.
